about make radical proposition are you sitting down the best time buy stocks when they cheapest duh but how many people forgot that two years ago have you given any thought when stocks are cheapest the answer during recession course now the middle one one the oldest investing nuggets all but happens true the time buy stocks when the future cloudiest have the numbers prove smartmoney compared month returns large cap stocks following the middle month the last recessions beginning with short economic slump the average gain for all those periods stunning percent makes the otherwise substantial percent average return for all other month periods since the beginning look puny middle the recession investing call this strategy works even better with small cap stocks the examples mid slump buys earned percent average versus percent average gains for all other periods but that just history you say won different this time some respects yes but you can ignore the past too bad most investors aren treating this like historic opportunity paltry billion flowed into equity mutual funds during the first nine months according the investment company institute mutual fund industry trade group compare that with the billion that stock funds attracted over the same period even worse this past september billion was withdrawn setting new one month record alas lots investors spooked though they might have been sept missed out the amp subsequent percent run through mid november not mention the percent rise the nasdaq over that time course lower inflows are normal recession thanks lower incomes unemployment has jumped from percent october percent year later forget about new contributions million more people will have start tapping their savings just get reduced savings means less potential for new stock investments bonuses and options other prime sources investing dollars have been cut back severely this year with that mind even september record outflows aren big sign failing faith among investors they might appear the number barely percent all equity mutual fund assets record only because there much more invested mutual funds now than there used october saw percent equity fund assets leave plus according leuthold group estimates investments stock funds once again turned positive october still clear that there far more reluctance invest these days despite the recent strong market rebound think that the wrong way atone for overeagerness invest for complete equity abstinence makes sense only you believe this recovery will materially different from those the past sure there are some real differences between previous recessions and this one and don want belittle them but don think they add case against investing right now the biggest difference lies the market average price earnings ratio ratio previous bear market recessions brought the down below its long term average that enabled stocks rebound strongly once became clear that the recession would end one two more quarters the best example when the collective the amp fell the following two years saw the index gain nearly percent despite the fact that corporate profits continued plagued high energy and labor costs investors just couldn resist equities bargain basement prices that won happen this time even after falling some percent the amp pricey any standard after adjusting for inflation and taking into account the fact that earnings are depressed the economic slowdown stocks remain highly valued they were just before the great depression clifford asness investment manager new york based money management firm aqr capital management has calculated that significant since found that the recession was the only one which the middle the recession strategy produced negative returns course also lasted twice long any other recession and that probably had more with the negative returns than anything else unlike other market skeptics asness doesn argue that stock necessarily have lower before new short term rally can start after all the past low rates inflation supported higher than average market small and midcap stocks are nowhere near expensive the large cap blue chips that dominate the amp index simply makes the common sense observation that you can expect rising help fuel powerful multiyear stock price boom and without similar room for 1970s style expansion you shouldn count the percent percent annual large cap returns seen over the past years what can you expect remain stable fall slightly over the next few years the rate gain will depend entirely how fast earnings grow healthy economic recovery that could average percent percent year for couple years comprising percent percent price increases percent percent gross domestic product growth and percent percent corporate profit enhancing cost controls naturally some sectors would grow faster and some slower than the average can you live with that you are tempted say consider this what are the alternatives money market yields slipped under percent year the second week november yields year treasurys are about percent but there good chance you locked into that investment for years you want ensure that return typically recovery interest rates rise meaning you face capital loss you try sell the bonds early and median home prices have increased only percent year since without even taking into account the carrying costs the past year has seen spate personal finance stories touting the advantages bonds cash and more exotic alternative investments very few these investments have the potential build wealth fast stocks even equities aren explosive they have been the recent past you were willing buy them when they were way overpriced and likely yield low returns why not buy them now and least get the benefit earnings recovery that will surely boost stock prices
