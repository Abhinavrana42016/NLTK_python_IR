So Medea made the cakes and Jason took them and threw them to the dragon.
The dragon ate them all and went to sleep.
Then Jason climbed over the dragon and took the nail out of the tree.
He put the golden fleece under his coat and ran to the ship Argo.
Medea went with him and became his wife.
Oh, how angry the king was! He had lost the golden fleece and the brass bulls and the dragon's teeth. And now his daughter was gone.
